	\section{Introduction}
	LinkedIn IdeaHub is an exclusive club designed for LinkedIn's verified professionals to share, view, fund, and protect innovative ideas. This platform bridges the gap between idea owners and potential investors, ensuring a secure and professional environment for innovation.
	
	\section{Features}
	\subsection{User Verification}
	Only LinkedIn verified users can access and share ideas, ensuring a professional and credible user base.
	
	\subsection{Idea Protection with NDA}
	Before accessing the details of an idea, users must undergo LinkedIn verification and agree to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). This safeguards the idea and ensures that it reaches a serious and credible audience.
	
	\subsection{Cryptographic Hashing and Blockchain Integration}
	Every interaction with an idea is securely recorded using cryptographic hashing, providing a tamper-proof record of all interactions. The cryptographic hashing system will be based on blockchain technology, ensuring every transaction is recorded in a secure manner.

	\section{AI-Based Idea Evaluation in IdeaHub}
	IdeaHub introduces an innovative approach to idea evaluation using AI. Inventors can submit their proposals, which are then analyzed by an AI system trained on hundreds of thousands of patents and their current market situations. Based on this analysis, ideas that meet a certain grade can benefit from IdeaHub's free global patenting procedure and funding.
	
	\subsection{Pros and Cons of AI-Based Evaluation}
	\subsubsection{Pros}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Efficiency in analyzing a large number of proposals.
		\item Objective and unbiased evaluations.
		\item Data-driven decisions based on historical patent and market data.
		\item Cost-effective in the long run.
		\item Consistent evaluation criteria.
		\item Integration with global patent databases for novelty checks.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Cons}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Potential lack of human intuition in understanding the context of an idea.
		\item Over-reliance on data which might not always be comprehensive.
		\item Technical challenges in implementing and maintaining the AI system.
		\item Possibility of errors if the AI is not trained adequately.
		\item Security concerns related to storing and analyzing proposals on servers.
	\end{itemize}

	
	\subsection{Funding Ecosystem with Private Coins}
	A seamless environment for potential investors to fund promising ideas using private coins exclusive to the IdeaHub ecosystem.
